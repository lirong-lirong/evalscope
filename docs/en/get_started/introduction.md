# Introduction

[EvalScope](https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope) is a comprehensive model evaluation and benchmarking framework meticulously crafted by the ModelScope community. It offers an all-in-one solution for your model assessment needs, regardless of the type of model you are developing:

- üß† Large Language Models
- üé® Multimodal Models
- üîç Embedding Models
- üèÜ Reranker Models
- üñºÔ∏è CLIP Models
- üé≠ AIGC Models (Text-to-Image/Video)
- ...and more!

EvalScope is not merely an evaluation tool; it is a valuable ally in your model optimization journey:

- üèÖ Equipped with multiple industry-recognized benchmarks and evaluation metrics such as MMLU, CMMLU, C-Eval, GSM8K, and others.
- üìä Performance stress testing for model inference to ensure your model excels in real-world applications.
- üöÄ Seamlessly integrates with the [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift) training framework, enabling one-click evaluations and providing end-to-end support from training to assessment for your model development.

2. Core Functions  
- **Multi-backend Evaluation**  
   - Native backends: Unified evaluation for LLM/VLM/Embedding/T2I models  
   - Integrated frameworks: OpenCompass/MTEB/VLMEvalKit/RAGAS  

- **Performance Monitoring**  
   - Model plugins: Supports various model service APIs  
   - Data plugins: Supports multiple data formats  
   - Metric tracking: TTFT/TPOP/Stability and other metrics  

- **Tool Extensions**  
   - Integration: Tool-Bench/Needle-in-a-Haystack/BFCL-v3  

3. Output Layer  
- **Structured Reports**: Supports JSON/Tables/Logs  
- **Visualization Platforms**: Supports Gradio/Wandb/SwanLab

## Framework Features
- **Benchmark Datasets**: Preloaded with several commonly used test benchmarks, including MMLU, CMMLU, C-Eval, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag, TruthfulQA, MATH, HumanEval, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements various commonly used evaluation metrics.

- **Automated Evaluation**: Includes automatic evaluation of objective questions and complex task evaluation using expert models.
- **Evaluation Reports**: Automatically generates evaluation reports.
- **Arena Mode**: Used for comparisons between models and objective evaluation of models, supporting various evaluation modes, including:
  - **Single mode**: Scoring a single model.
  - **Pairwise-baseline mode**: Comparing against a baseline model.
  - **Pairwise (all) mode**: Pairwise comparison among all models.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides intuitive displays of evaluation results.
- **Model Performance Evaluation**: Offers a performance testing tool for model inference services and detailed statistics, see [Model Performance Evaluation Documentation](../user_guides/stress_test/index.md).
- **OpenCompass Integration**: Supports OpenCompass as the evaluation backend, providing advanced encapsulation and task simplification, allowing for easier task submission for evaluation.
- **VLMEvalKit Integration**: Supports VLMEvalKit as the evaluation backend, facilitating the initiation of multi-modal evaluation tasks, supporting various multi-modal models and datasets.
- **Full-Link Support**: Through seamless integration with the [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift) training framework, provides a one-stop development process for model training, model deployment, model evaluation, and report viewing, enhancing user development efficiency.
