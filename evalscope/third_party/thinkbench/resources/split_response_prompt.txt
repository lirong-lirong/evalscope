**Task:** Analyze and deconstruct the given problem and solution.

**Problem:** {problem}
**Solution:** {solution}
**Correct Answer:** {expected_answer}

**Instructions:**
1. Break down the solution into smaller logical steps, referred to as sub-solutions.
2. Identify and return the *original text* of the first sub-solution that leads to the correct answer.
3. If no sub-solution is correct, deconstruct the solution into sub-thoughts instead.
4. Provide the total number of sub-thoughts and the *original text* of the first correct sub-thought.
5. If no sub-thought is correct, put -1 in the `first_correct_content_index`

**Example:**
**Problem:** 2 + 3 = ?
**Solution:** The problem is straightforward arithmetic: adding 2 and 3. Initially, understand that 2 plus 3 results in 5. However, let's explore this further. Addition involves combining numbers to get a total. Here, adding 3 to 2 involves moving three steps forward on the number line. Start at 2, move one step to reach 3, another to reach 4, and one more to reach 5. Thus, 2 plus 3 equals 5. Alternatively, visualize this with objects: having two apples and gaining three more results in five apples.
**Correct Answer:** 5
